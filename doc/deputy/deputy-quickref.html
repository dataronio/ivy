<h2>Deputy Quick Reference</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Run <tt>ivycc --deputy</tt> on a C file in place of <tt>gcc</tt>.  (In many
cases, this is as simple as changing <tt>CC</tt> in your makefile.)  You
will probably see a number of type errors, beginning with a series of
warnings that suggest annotations.  You can fix these errors by inserting
annotations listed below.  Hairier parts of the code can be skipped using
the "trusted" annotations below.  Once your file compiles, you'll need to
use <tt>deputy</tt> for the linker as well so that Deputy can link in its
(small) runtime library.</p>

<p>Now run and test your program.  You will probably see some run-time
errors due to insufficient or incorrect annotations.  Fix these errors and
you're good to go!</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Pointer and Array Bounds</h3>

<p>Pointer annotations are placed after the <tt>*</tt> in the pointer
type.  Array annotations are placed immediately before the name of the
array, using parentheses.  For example, the <tt>COUNT(42)</tt> annotation
can be placed as follows:</p>

<div class="code">int * COUNT(42) ptr;
int (COUNT(42) array)[]:
</div>

<p>The basic Deputy bounds annotations are given in the following table.
The type checker assumes that every pointer and array in the program is
annotated with one of these annotations.  Deputy will provide a suitable
default for each unannotated pointer.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>BOUND(b,&nbsp;e)</tt><br/>
<tt>BND(b,&nbsp;e)</tt></td>
<td>The pointer is either null or it points to an array of objects of the
base type with bounds given by the local expressions <tt>b</tt> and
<tt>e</tt>.  This pointer must be aligned with respect to both <tt>b</tt>
and <tt>e</tt>.  The keyword <tt>__this</tt> refers to the variable or
expression to which this type is attached.  To use automatic bounds,
specify <tt>__auto</tt> in place of <tt>b</tt> and/or <tt>e</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>COUNT(n)</tt>
<tt>CT(n)</tt></td>
<td>The pointer is either null or it points to an array of <tt>n</tt>
objects of the base type.  Equivalent to <tt>BOUND(__this, __this +
n)</tt>.  This annotation is the default for arrays with declared size
<tt>n</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>SAFE</tt></td>
<td>The pointer is either null or it bounds to a single object of the base
type.  Equivalent to <tt>COUNT(1)</tt> and <tt>BOUND(__this, __this +
1)</tt>.  This annotation is the default for global variables, structure
fields, and function arguments and return values.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>SNT</tt></td>
<td>This pointer is used only for comparison and never for dereference.
Mostly equivalent to <tt>COUNT(0)</tt> and <tt>BOUND(__this, __this)</tt>,
but currently carries an extra attribute that allows it to be incremented
and decremented freely.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>SEQ</tt></td>
<td>A shorthand for <tt>BOUND(__auto, __auto)</tt>.  Deputy will insert
automatic bounds variables for both bounds.  Note that this annotation
must be used with care on any externally-visible data!  This annotation is
the default for local variables.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>FSEQ</tt></td>
<td>A shorthand for <tt>BOUND(__this, __auto)</tt>.  Deputy will insert
an automatic bounds variable for the upper bound, and the lower bound is
assumed to be the pointer itself.  As with <tt>SEQ</tt>, this annotation
must be used with care on any externally-visible data!</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>You may also indicate whether a pointer is non-null with the following
annotations:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>NONNULL</tt></td>
<td>Indicates that a pointer must be non-null.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>OPT</tt></td>
<td>Indicates that a pointer may be null.  This annotation is the default
on all pointers.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<hr/>

<h3>Null-Terminated Pointers and Arrays</h3>

<p>In addition to the bounds annotations provided above, you may also
indicate that a pointer or array is null-terminated by using one of the
following annotations:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>NT</tt></td>
<td>Indicates that the upper bound of the pointer (as given by
<tt>BOUND</tt> or one of its relatives) is the beginning of a
null-terminated sequence of elements.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>NTS</tt></td>
<td>A shorthand for <tt>NT COUNT(0)</tt>--think "null-terminated string".
This annotation is often used for <tt>char *</tt> pointers that represent
null-terminated strings.  Note that because it includes a <tt>COUNT</tt>
annotation, it is provided in place of (rather than in addition to) the
bounds annotations in the previous section.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>There are two operations that allow you to convert between
null-terminated and regular pointers:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>NTDROP(e)</tt></td>
<td>Converts a null-terminated pointer <tt>e</tt> with type <tt>NT BOUND(b,
e)</tt> into a standard pointer with bounds <tt>BOUND(b, e)</tt>.  Because
the null terminator lies outside of the specified bounds, this operation
is safe; however, the null element (and any other elements outside the
specified bounds) may no longer be accessible.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>NTEXPAND(e)</tt></td>
<td>Expands the upper bound of <tt>e</tt> up to the null element.  For
example, if <tt>e</tt> has type <tt>NT COUNT(0)</tt> but points to a
string with 5 characters (plus a null character), then
<tt>NTEXPAND(e)</tt> will have type <tt>NT COUNT(5)</tt>.  This operation
is often used immediately before an <tt>NTDROP</tt> in order to preserve
access to all elements except for the null terminator itself.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<hr/>

<h3>Union Annotations</h3>

<p>Unions are annotated by indicating when each field is active.  For
example:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo {
    int tag;
    union foo {
        int *p  WHEN(tag == 0);
        int n   WHEN(tag == 1);
    } u;
};
</div>

<p>Note that the annotation is placed after the name of each field, not on
the type of each field.  The annotation is defined as follows:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>WHEN(e)</tt></td>
<td>Indicates that the associated union field is selected when the local
expression <tt>e</tt> evaluates to a non-zero value.  The expression
<tt>e</tt> is local with respect to the union itself, so it can refer to
other names at the same level as the union.  At most one field may be
selected at any given time.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<hr/>

<h3>Special Function Annotations</h3>

<p>Deputy provides annotations that identify several common C functions
that require special treatment.  These annotations are placed on the
function type by writing them before the name of the function, in
parentheses.  For example:</p>

<p><tt>void * (DALLOC(sz) malloc)(size_t sz);</tt></p>

<p>These annotations are as follows:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>DALLOC(e)</tt></td>
<td>This annotation indicates a function that acts as an allocator.  The
expression <tt>e</tt> indicates the size of the allocated block (in bytes)
in terms of the function's formal parameters.  The type of the allocation
is determined by the pointer to which the result of this call is assigned,
and the size is used to check (or set, in the case of automatic bounds)
the bounds of the resulting pointer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>DFREE(p)</tt></td>
<td>This annotation indicates a function that frees memory.  The argument
<tt>p</tt> is the name of the formal parameter for the pointer being
freed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="100"><tt>DREALLOC(p,&nbsp;e)</tt></td>
<td>This annotation indicates a function that acts as a reallocator; the
arguments <tt>p</tt> and <tt>e</tt> function as specified in the previous
two annotations.  Note that newly-allocated portions of the array are
<em>not</em> automatically zeroed by Deputy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>DMEMCPY(x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z)</tt><br/>
<tt>DMEMSET(x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z)</tt><br/>
<tt>DMEMCMP(x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z)</tt>
</td>
<td>These annotations specify that the function behaves like
<tt>memcpy</tt>, <tt>memset</tt>, or <tt>memcmp</tt>.  The three arguments
<tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt> are meant to indicate the indices
of the arguments that behave like the corresponding arguments for the
original function; however, they are ignored by the current
implementation.  When Deputy sees a call to a function with one of these
annotations, it verifies the bounds of the pointers passed to these
functions, and when data is being written, it verifies that the data
written has the correct type.  In the case of <tt>memset</tt>, we allow
arrays containing pointers to be initialized to zero (assuming, of course,
that those pointers are not non-null).</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Trusted Annotations</h3>

<p>Deputy allows the user to trust code in cases where Deputy annotations
cannot easily be provided.  There are several ways to indicate trusted
code:</p>

<p>First, you may specify trusted blocks of code.  If you place
<tt>TRUSTEDBLOCK</tt> after the opening brace of a block, Deputy will not
attempt to check any code contained therein.  If this block reads
variables with automatic bounds, Deputy will adjust the code as necessary
to allow the read to occur.  However, writes to variables with automatic
bounds are not allowed.</p>

<p>Second, you may use the <tt>TRUSTED</tt> annotation, which can appear
in three places:</p>

<ul>

<li>On a pointer, the <tt>TRUSTED</tt> annotation causes Deputy to trust
any casts into or out of that pointer as well as any arithmetic operations
on that pointer.  When casting from a trusted pointer to a non-trusted
pointer, the bounds on the non-trusted pointer must be given explicitly.
(Automatic bounds can still be used as long as they are explicitly
requested with an annotation such as <tt>SEQ</tt>.)</li>

<li>On a union, the <tt>TRUSTED</tt> annotation causes Deputy to suppress
any tag checks assocated with that union.  This annotation can be placed
after the <tt>union</tt> keyword or after the closing brace of the
union.</li>

<li>On a function, the <tt>TRUSTED</tt> annotation tells Deputy not to
process the local variables or the function body.  As with
<tt>TRUSTEDBLOCK</tt>, Deputy will adjust reads of variables with
automatic bounds appropriately but will disallow writes to such
variables.</li>

</ul>

<p>For convenience, you can use the macro <tt>TC(e)</tt> to convert a
pointer expression <tt>e</tt> to a trusted version of the same pointer.
This macro is very useful for performing trusted casts from one pointer
type to another.</p>
