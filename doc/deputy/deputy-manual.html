<h3>1. What is Deputy?</h3>

<p>Deputy is the part of <a href="http://ivy.cs.berkeley.edu">Ivy</a>
that enforces type discipline on C programs. Among other things, it
verifies that pointers stay within their designated bounds, and it
ensures that union fields are used safely.</p>

<p>In order to get type safety using Deputy, you must first supply
some lightweight type annotations.  For the most part, these annotations
are required on function arguments and return values, structure fields,
and global variables--that is, the interfaces to each source file.
Deputy's annotations are designed to reflect common programming idioms;
for example, you can easily say that a pointer <tt>p</tt> points to an
array of length <tt>n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is another variable in the
program.  Deputy then verifies your program through a combination of
compile-time and run-time checking.  This approach allows us to verify a
wide range of real-world programs (even Linux device drivers!) in return
for a slight performance penalty.</p>

<p>Deputy differs from previous tools for safe C compilation in that it
allows the programmer to specify pointer bounds and union tags using
<i>dependent types</i>--that is, using annotations that depend on other
variables or fields in your program.  As a result, Deputy requires fewer
modifications to the original program and makes less invasive changes to
the program during compilation.  Deputy produces object files that can be
linked directly to object files produced by other compilers; thus, the
programmer can choose to enable Deputy on a file-by-file basis, and
programs compiled with Deputy can be linked directly with existing C
libraries.</p>

<p>An earlier version of Deputy is available as a 
standalone tool at <a href="http://deputy.cs.berkeley.edu">
http://deputy.cs.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<a name="basic-usage"/>
<h3>2. Basic Usage</h3>

<a name="invoking-deputy"/>
<h4>2.1. Invoking Deputy</h4>

<p>Deputy is part of Ivy, whose <tt>ivycc</tt> driver is a drop-in
replacement for <tt>gcc</tt>. To enable Deputy's checks, you must pass
the <tt>--deputy</tt> option to <tt>ivycc</tt>. Thus, for example, if
you want to compile the C source file <tt>foo.c</tt> to the object
file <tt>foo.o</tt>, you can use the following command:</p>

<div class="code">% ivycc --deputy -c -o foo.o foo.c
</div>

<p>If you're using Deputy on an existing C project, all you need to do is
to set the <tt>CC</tt> variable in your <tt>Makefile</tt> to 
<tt>ivycc --deputy</tt>.</p>

<p>The object files produced by Deputy are compatible with object files
produced by <tt>gcc</tt>, so you can link them with the standard linker.
However, Deputy-generated object files need to eventually be linked with
Deputy's runtime library, which has code to handle run-time failures.  If
you use <tt>ivycc</tt> as your linker (much as <tt>gcc</tt> is often used
as the linker), the runtime library will automatically be linked when an
executable is created.  For example, to link <tt>foo.o</tt> and
<tt>bar.o</tt> to create an executable <tt>foobar</tt>, you can use the
following command:</p>

<div class="code">% ivycc --deputy -o foobar foo.o bar.o
</div>

<a name="edit-compile-debug"/>
<h4>2.2. Edit, Compile, Debug</h4>

<p>Using Deputy is much like the familiar edit-compile-debug cycle for any
other compiler.  When you run Deputy on a C file, it will emit a number of
warnings and errors that either suggest annotations or indicate errors.
Your job as the programmer is to address these warnings and errors by
adding annotations or changing code.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>

<div class="code">int sum(int *data, int length) {
    int i, sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i <= length; i++) {
	sum += data[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
</div>

<p>Assuming this code is in a file called <tt>sum.c</tt>, we could compile
it as follows:</p>

<div class="code">% ivycc --deputy -c -o sum.o sum.c
sum.c:1: Warning: Type "int *" in formal "data" of sum needs a bound annotation.
</div>

<p>We got a warning, but it compiled.  Now let's build a program that
calls the <tt>sum()</tt> function with an array of length 5.</p>

<div class="code">% gcc -c -o test-sum.o test-sum.c
% ivycc --deputy -o test-sum test-sum.o sum.o
</div>

<p>Note that we compiled the test code with <tt>gcc</tt>, since the
resulting object files can be linked directly with the ones produced by
<tt>ivycc</tt>.  Note also that we linked with <tt>ivycc</tt> so that we
get Deputy's runtime library.</p>

<p>Now let's run this program:</p>

<div class="code">% ./test-sum
sum.c:4: sum: Assertion failed in upper bound check:
  data + i + 1 <= data + 1 (with no overflow)
Execution aborted.
</div>

<p>The reason for this assertion is that Deputy assumed that the
<tt>data</tt> argument to <tt>sum()</tt> pointed to a single integer, not
an array of integers.  When the <tt>sum()</tt> function attempted to
access integers beyond the first element of this array, a Deputy run-time
error was triggered.  Note that the warning provided by Deputy at compile
time indicated that something about this code was fishy.</p>

<p>We can fix this error by adding an annotation to the <tt>int*</tt>
type, as follows:</p>

<div class="code">int sum(int * <span class="annot">COUNT(length)</span> data, int length) {
    int i, sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i <= length; i++) {
	sum += data[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
</div>

<p>This annotation tells Deputy that <tt>length</tt> stores the length of
<tt>data</tt>.  Now if we compile and run the above program, we will see
no warnings or errors:</p>

<div class="code">% ivycc --deputy -c -o sum.o sum.c
% gcc -c -o test-sum.o test-sum.c
% ivycc --deputy -o test-sum test-sum.o sum.o
% ./test-sum
</div>

<p>Deputy provides many such annotations to describe common programming
idioms.  In the following sections, we will discuss Deputy's pointer
annotations in detail.</p>

<hr/>

<a name="pointer-bounds-annotations"/>
<h3>3. Pointer Bounds Annotations</h3>

<a name="syntax"/>
<h4>3.1. Syntax</h4>

<p>Most Deputy annotations are written as type annotations that are
written immediately after the type to which they are attached.  For
example:</p>

<div class="code">int * <span class="annot">SAFE</span> p;</div>

<p>This code declares a variable <tt>p</tt> of type <tt>int * SAFE</tt>.
In this example, <tt>SAFE</tt> is a Deputy annotation attached to the
pointer type <tt>int *</tt>.  In general, any annotations appearing after
a <tt>*</tt> apply to that pointer type.</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<div class="code">int main(int argc, char * <span class="annot">NTS</span> * <span class="annot">NT COUNT(argc)</span> argv);</div>

<p>This example shows the Deputy annotations for <tt>main</tt>.  The
<tt>NTS</tt> annotation applies to the first pointer (the inner <tt>char
*</tt>), and the <tt>NT</tt> and <tt>COUNT(argc)</tt> annotations apply to
the second pointer (the outer <tt>char **</tt>).  Overall, this annotation
says that <tt>argv</tt> is a null-terminated sequence with a minimum
length of <tt>argc</tt>.  Each element of this sequence is a
null-terminated string.  (These annotations will be discussed in detail
below!)</p>

<a name="safe-pointers"/>
<h4>3.2. Safe Pointers</h4>

<p>The first Deputy annotation that we will introduce is the "safe"
pointer.  Safe pointers are possibly-null pointers to a single object of
their base type.  For example:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo * <span class="annot">SAFE</span> p;</div>

<p>This code declares a pointer <tt>p</tt> that is either null or points
to a single object of type <tt>struct foo</tt>.</p>

<p>Safe pointers are typically used much like Java references: they can be
passed around and dereferenced, but they are not used in pointer
arithmetic.  Such pointers are by far the most common kind of pointers in
C programs.</p>

<p>When you dereference a safe pointer, Deputy will insert a null check
(or its equivalent).  However, if your code has already checked this
pointer to ensure that it is non-null, Deputy's optimizer will most likely
remove the Deputy-inserted null check.  Deputy's will also issue
compile-time errors for obviously-incorrect code such as <tt>p[1]</tt>.</p>

<p>If you are sure that the pointer is never null, you can add the
<tt>NONNULL</tt> annotation.  For example:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo * <span class="annot">SAFE NONNULL</span> p;</div>

<p>Since this pointer is annotated as both <tt>SAFE</tt> and
<tt>NONNULL</tt>, it can typically be dereferenced at zero run-time
cost.</p>

<a name="count-pointers"/>
<h4>3.3. Count Pointers</h4>

<p>Of course, many C programs use pointers to point to <em>arrays</em> of
objects.  Such pointers can be annotated as "count" pointers:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo * <span class="annot">COUNT(5)</span> p;</div>

<p>This annotation says that <tt>p</tt> is either null or it points to an
array of five valid objects of type <tt>struct foo</tt>.  For the visually
inclined, the memory layout is as follows, where each blue box represents
an object of type <tt>struct foo</tt>:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="count-5.png"/>
</div>

<p>Note that the <tt>SAFE</tt> annotation introduced earlier is actually
equivalent to <tt>COUNT(1)</tt>.  Also note that this annotation can be
written as <tt>CT</tt> instead of <tt>COUNT</tt> if you prefer terse
annotations.</p>

<p>In addition to using the count annotation with constants, the count
annotation can also refer to other variables in the same
scope or to more complex expressions.  For example:</p>

<div class="code">int n, m;
struct foo * <span class="annot">COUNT(n * m)</span> p;
</div>

<p>Here, we've declared that <tt>p</tt> is a pointer to an array of <tt>n
* m</tt> objects of type <tt>struct foo</tt> (a two-dimensional array,
perhaps).  Visually, we have the following memory layout:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="count-nm.png"/>
</div>

<p>If we refer to an element <tt>p[i]</tt> of this array, Deputy
will verify that <tt>p</tt> is non-null and that <tt>0 &lt;= i &lt; n *
m</tt>.

<p>When count annotations refer to variables, they may refer only to
variables in the immediately enclosing scope.  For example, annotations on
local variables may only refer to other local variables, and annotations
on structure fields may only refer to other structure fields.
Furthermore, these annotations may not include memory dereferences or
function calls.  These restrictions allow Deputy to efficiently verify
that a variable's type annotation is valid for the duration of that
variable's lifetime.</p>

<p>Finally, note that count annotations (and indeed, all Deputy
annotations) must be valid throughout the variable's lifetime.  Thus, in
the previous example, Deputy will prevent you from incrementing <tt>n</tt>
or <tt>m</tt>, since this change might invalidate the annotation on
<tt>p</tt>.  Furthermore, <tt>p</tt> cannot be incremented, because then
<tt>p</tt> would no longer point to an array of <tt>n * m</tt> elements.
(If you're worried that this sounds too restrictive, bear with me until
the section on automatic bounds!)</p>

<a name="general-bounded-pointers"/>
<h4>3.4. General Bounded Pointers</h4>

<p>The most general annotation provided by Deputy is the "bound"
annotation, which is written as follows:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo * <span class="annot">BOUND(b, e)</span> p;</div>

<p>This annotation says that <tt>p</tt> is either null or points into
an array of objects of type <tt>struct foo</tt> with bounds <tt>b</tt> and
<tt>e</tt>.  All of these pointers (<tt>p</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and
<tt>e</tt>) must be aligned with respect to the size of <tt>struct
foo</tt>.  Visually, the memory layout is:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="bnd-be.png"/>
</div>

<p>As with the count annotation, the arguments <tt>b</tt> and <tt>e</tt>
can actually be expressions that refer to other variables or fields in the
same scope.  The same restrictions that apply to count pointers apply here
as well.  As with the count annotation, you can write <tt>BND</tt> as the
terse form of <tt>BOUND</tt>.</p>

<p>In this annotation, the expressions <tt>b</tt> and <tt>e</tt> can make use of
the special variable <tt>__this</tt>, which refers to the variable, field,
or expression to which this type is attached.  So, for example, the
annotation <tt>BOUND(__this, __this + n)</tt> says that the bounds of the
associated pointer are the pointer itself and the pointer plus <tt>n</tt>
elements.  In fact, this is precisely how <tt>COUNT(n)</tt> is
defined!</p>

<a name="sentinel-pointers"/>
<h4>3.5. Sentinel Pointers</h4>

<p>One final pointer annotation to be discussed is the sentinel pointer.
In Deputy, the sentinel annotation, written <tt>SNT</tt>, indicates that a
pointer is used only for comparisons and not for dereference.  Such
pointers are useful mainly for indicating the bounds of other pointers.
They are also useful for C idioms where the program computes the address
of the end of an array.</p>

<p>In terms of the general bounded pointer, a sentinel pointer is
equivalent to <tt>BOUND(__this, __this)</tt>--that is, the pointer is both
its upper and lower bound.</p>

<a name="null-terminated-pointers"/>
<h4>3.6. Null-Terminated Pointers</h4>

<p>The annotations introduced thus far allow you to specify pointer bounds
by referring to other nearby variables.  However, bounds for arrays are
sometimes indicated using null termination instead.</p>

<p>Deputy handles null-termination with an additional annotation,
<tt>NT</tt>, that can be used <em>in addition to</em> the
previously-discussed bounds annotations.  In other words, you have the
option of specifying <tt>NT</tt> in addition to <tt>BOUND</tt> or one of its
shorthands (<tt>SAFE</tt>, <tt>COUNT</tt>, and <tt>SNT</tt>).</p>

<p>The meaning of this annotation is that the <em>upper</em> bound given
by the <tt>BOUND</tt> annotation is the beginning of a null-terminated
sequence.  So, the annotation <tt>NT COUNT(5)</tt> describes an array of
five elements followed by a null-terminated sequence (or, in other words,
a null-terminated sequence of at least five elements).  This annotation
allows the null element to be read but not overwritten with a non-zero
value.  A sequence with no known bounds (e.g., a standard C string) is
written as <tt>NT COUNT(0)</tt>, which can be abbreviated as
<tt>NTS</tt>.</p>

<p>In its most general form, the annotation <tt>NT BOUND(b, e)</tt>
corresponds to the following memory layout:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="bnd-be-nt.png"/>
</div>

<p>Note that the initial portion of the array is laid out in the same way
as <tt>BOUND(b, e)</tt>; the only difference is that we have a
null-terminated sequence (shown as the pink boxes) at the end.</p>

<p>This hybrid design is important in ensuring that bounded sequences and
null-terminated sequences interact cleanly.  For example, C programs often
have stack-allocated arrays that have a known size and are
null-terminated.  If we did not mark it as null-terminated, we would not
be able to call <tt>strlen()</tt> and its like on this buffer.  If we
marked it as null-terminated only, then we would not be able to insert
null elements in this buffer without cutting off access to the remainder
of the buffer.</p>

<p>Note that it is always legal to cast away the <tt>NT</tt> flag; for
example, a <tt>NT COUNT(5)</tt> sequence can safely be considered to be a
<tt>COUNT(5)</tt> sequence, although you lose access to the
null-terminated portion of the array.  This operation can be performed
with the <tt>NTDROP(e)</tt> function.</p>

<p>One complication with <tt>NTDROP</tt> is that you lose a lot of bounds
information.  For example, strings are typically annotated <tt>char *
NTS</tt>, and calling <tt>NTDROP</tt> on such a value results in a value
of type <tt>char * COUNT(0)</tt>, which is not very useful.  Thus, we also
provide <tt>NTEXPAND(e)</tt>, which expands the bounds of the expression
<tt>e</tt> dynamically.  So, <tt>NTDROP(NTEXPAND(e))</tt> yields a
non-null-terminated type with the largest legal bounds.</p>

<a name="casts"/>
<h4>3.7. Casts</h4>

<p>Deputy has stricter checking of type casts than C itself.  First,
Deputy checks to make sure that the bounds of the type being cast are
correct.  For example, a <tt>COUNT(5)</tt> pointer could be cast to a
<tt>COUNT(4)</tt> pointer, but not the other way around.  When necessary,
Deputy will insert run-time checks to verify that such casts are safe.
Since all the bounds annotations are special cases of <tt>BOUND</tt>, they
can all be cast freely from one to the other.</p>

<p>Deputy also ensures that the <tt>NT</tt> flag is either present or
absent on both sides of the cast.  (In fact, Deputy infers the <tt>NT</tt>
flag in these situations, as we will discuss in the next section.)  The
only way to drop the <tt>NT</tt> flag is to use the <tt>NTDROP</tt>
function discussed above.  The <tt>NT</tt> flag can never be added by a
cast; it must be present from the point of allocation forward.</p>

<p>Finally, Deputy checks the base types of pointers involved in a cast.
For example, you are not allowed to blindly cast an <tt>int **</tt> to an
<tt>int *</tt>, since otherwise you could overwrite a pointer with an
integer.  Similarly, you are not allowed to cast a non-pointer type to a
pointer.  However, when casting between pointers to non-pointer data
(e.g., <tt>int *</tt> to <tt>char *</tt>), Deputy will allow the cast.</p>

<a name="trusted-code"/>
<h4>3.8. Trusted Code</h4>

<p>If you must use a cast that Deputy doesn't like, you can use the
<tt>TC(e)</tt> function to perform a trusted cast from an expression
<tt>e</tt> to some new type.  For example, the following cast will be
accepted by Deputy:</p>

<div class="code">int * <span class="annot">SAFE</span> * <span class="annot">SAFE</span> pp = ...;
int * <span class="annot">SAFE</span> p = (int * <span class="annot">SAFE</span>) <span class="op">TC</span>(pp);
</div>

<p>Alternatively, any pointer can be labelled as trusted by using the
<tt>TRUSTED</tt> annotations.  Trusted pointers can be cast to any other
pointer without compile-time or run-time checks.  Similarly, these
pointers can be incremented or decremented without restriction.  (In fact,
the <tt>TC</tt> operation is implemented as a cast to a <tt>TRUSTED</tt>
pointer of the same type.)</p>

<hr/>

<a name="inference"/>
<h3>4. Inference</h3>

<p>Deputy has several inference features that reduce the number of
annotations required for type checking.  Most of these features operate
behind the scenes, but it is important for the programmer to be aware of
what they do.</p>

<a name="default-annotations"/>
<h4>4.1. Default Annotations</h4>

<p>Any types that may be visible by code outside the current compilation
unit are given the default annotation of <tt>SAFE</tt>.  These types
include the types of global variables, function arguments, function return
values, structure fields, and the base types of other pointers.  This
annotation is correct in the vast majority of cases, so it is quite useful
for the programmer to be able to omit it.</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that this assumption is <em>not</em>
safe and is provided only for convenience.  For example, imagine that your
code calls a function <tt>foo(char *p)</tt> in another module.  If this
function expects a null-terminated string and we assume a <tt>SAFE</tt>
annotation, then Deputy would allow you to pass a pointer to a single
character when a string was expected.  Fortunately, such errors will be
detected when running Deputy on the code for <tt>foo()</tt> itself;
furthermore, header files for standard libraries should soon be fully
annotated.  In the near future, we will include an option to warn the
programmer about such assumptions.</p>

<a name="automatic-bounds"/>
<h4>4.2. Automatic Bounds</h4>

<p>For the types of local variables and types appearing in casts, Deputy
can do a bit more to help the programmer.  In these situations, Deputy
assumes that unannotated types have the annotation <tt>BOUND(__auto,
__auto)</tt>.  In this context, <tt>__auto</tt> is a special keyword that
instructs Deputy to generate a new variable to hold and track the
appropriate bound.  For example, say we have the following
declaration:</p>

<div class="code">int a[10];
int * <span class="annot">BOUND(__auto, __auto)</span> p;
p = a;
</div>

<p>After preprocessing, this code becomes:</p>

<div class="code">int a[10];
int * <span class="annot">SNT</span> pb;
int * <span class="annot">SNT</span> pe;
int * <span class="annot">BOUND(pb, pe)</span> p;
pb = a;
pe = a + 10;
p = a;
</div>

<p>Note that we have introduced two new bounds variables to track the
bounds of <tt>p</tt>, and we updated these bounds variables when
<tt>p</tt> was updated.</p>

<p>These automatic bounds variables are very useful beyond their ability
to reduce the annotation burden.  In many cases, programmers wish to
explicitly introduce new bounds variables when existing code is not
amenable to annotation.  As mentioned earlier, <tt>COUNT</tt> pointers
cannot be incremented; however, if you copy a <tt>COUNT</tt> pointer into
an unannotated pointer, then this unannotated pointer can be incremented,
since its bounds are stored in two fresh variables.</p>

<a name="nt-inference"/>
<h4>4.3. NT Inference</h4>

<p>In addition to the above inference, Deputy also infers <tt>NT</tt>
annotations using somewhat more traditional means.  Essentially, any
pointer that is casted to/from or assigned to/from an <tt>NT</tt> pointer
becomes <tt>NT</tt> itself.  Of course, this inference algorithm
understands the <tt>NTDROP</tt> function and does not propagate
<tt>NT</tt> across this operation.</p>

<p>This feature reduces the burden of <tt>NT</tt> annotation dramatically,
but it can also infer unintended <tt>NT</tt> annotations.  In most cases,
this problem results from a common function like <tt>memset()</tt>.  If an
<tt>NT</tt> pointer is inadvertendly passed to <tt>memset()</tt> without
using <tt>NTDROP</tt>, the <tt>NT</tt> flag will be propagated to
<tt>memset()</tt>'s argument and from there to all other pointers passed
to <tt>memset()</tt>, most of which are not <tt>NT</tt>.  To solve this
problem, search for common functions like <tt>memset()</tt> and make sure
to use <tt>NTDROP</tt> when appropriate.</p>

<hr/>

<a name="union-annotations"/>
<h3>5. Union Annotations</h3>

<a name="tagged-unions"/>
<h4>5.1. Tagged Unions</h4>

<p>In addition to pointer bounds errors, unions provide another source of
unsafety in C programs.  As with pointer bounds, Deputy provides a way to
annotate common idioms used to ensure the safety of unions.</p>

<p>In Deputy, each union field must be annotated with a predicate
indicating the condition that must hold when that field of the union is
currently active.  For example, consider the following annotated C
code:</p>

<div class="code">struct foo {
    int tag;
    union {
        int n   <span class="annot">WHEN(tag == 1)</span>;
        int *p  <span class="annot">WHEN(tag == 2)</span>;
    } u;
}
</div>

<p>Without any checking, this union is potentially unsafe, because a
program could write an aribtary integer to the field <tt>u.n</tt> and then
read it out as a pointer by reading <tt>u.p</tt>.  The <tt>WHEN</tt>
annotations indicate that the <tt>n</tt> field can only be accessed when
<tt>tag</tt> is 1, and the <tt>p</tt> field can only be accessed when
<tt>tag</tt> is 2.  When changing the tag, the contents of the union must
be zero, which is assumed to be a valid value for all data types.</p>

<p>There are a few differences between the usage of this annotation and
the usage of the pointer bounds annotations.  First, if the <tt>WHEN</tt>
fields refer to variables, they must be variables in the same scope as the
union, not fields of the union itself.  (In the above example, we refer to
<tt>tag</tt> as opposed to <tt>n</tt> and <tt>p</tt>.)  Second, these
annotations are placed on the union fields themselves, not on their
types--that is, they appear <em>after</em> the field name.  The reason for
these differences is that the <tt>WHEN</tt> fields are conceptually
annotations on the union type, not on the fields of the union.</p>

<a name="trusted-unions"/>
<h4>5.2. Trusted Unions</h4>

<p>As with bounded pointers, unions can be trusted when the tag
annotations are insufficient.  To do so, simply place the <tt>TRUSTED</tt>
annotation on the union itself.  For example:</p>

<div class="code">union {
    int n;
    int *p;
} <span class="annot">TRUSTED</span> u;
</div>

<a name="polymorphism"/>
<h3>6. Polymorphism</h3>

<p>C programmers typically use <tt>void *</tt> in cases where a number of
different types may be used.  However, casts to and from this <tt>void
*</tt> are not checked for safety.  Deputy provides parametric
polymorphism to handle some of these cases.</p>

<a name="polymorphism-in-functions"/>
<h4>6.1. Polymorphism in Functions</h4>

<p>Function arguments can be treated as polymorphic.  Instead of writing
<tt>void *</tt>, use the type <tt>TV(t)</tt>, which stands for "type
variable named <tt>t</tt>".  Any occurrences of this type that have the
same name <tt>t</tt> must be the same type for any particular call to this
function.  For example:</p>

<div class="code">void apply(void (*fn)(<span class="annot">TV(t)</span> data), <span class="annot">TV(t)</span> data);
void callback_int(int data);
void callback_ptr(int *data);

int i;
apply(callback_int, i);   // TV(t) == int
apply(callback_ptr, &amp;i);  // TV(t) == int *
</div>

<p>In Deputy, the above code is well-typed.  Note that apply can safely be
instantiated on two different types, but those types must be used
consistently for any particular call to <tt>apply</tt>.  Note also that
you can use several distinct type variables if you give them different
names (i.e., change <tt>t</tt> to something else).</p>

<p>For practical reasons, Deputy requires that <tt>TV(t)</tt> is only
instantiated to types that can fit in a machine word, like an integer or
pointer--basically, anything that you were previously casting to/from a
<tt>void *</tt>.</p>

<p>Within a polymorphic function, you may not make any assumptions about
data whose type is a type variable.  All you can do is copy this data to
other variables with the same type variable type.  The body of
<tt>apply</tt> would look like this:</p>

<div class="code">void apply(void (*fn)(<span class="annot">TV(t)</span> data), <span class="annot">TV(t)</span> data) {
    fn(data);
}
</div>

<p>This call to <tt>fn</tt> is only legal because <tt>data</tt> and the
first argument to <tt>fn</tt> both have type <tt>TV(t)</tt>.</p>

<a name="polymorphic-structures"/>
<h4>6.2. Polymorphic Structures</h4>

<p>You can also use polymorphism within a structure.  In our current
implementation, structures may only have one type variable, which must be
named <tt>t</tt>.  (These restrictions will be lifted in a future
version.)  When using such a structure, you must use the annotation
<tt>TP</tt> to specify the type on which it is instantiated.  For
example:</p>

<div class="code">struct list {
    <span class="annot">TV(t)</span> data;
    struct list <span class="annot">TP(TV(t))</span> *next;
};

struct list <span class="annot">TP(int)</span>   *int_list;
struct list <span class="annot">TP(int *)</span> *ptr_list;

int i;
int_list-&gt;next-&gt;data = i;   // data has type int
ptr_list-&gt;next-&gt;data = &amp;i;  // data has type int *
</div>

<p>Here we declare two lists, one a list of <tt>int</tt> and one a list
of <tt>int *</tt>, as specified by <tt>TP</tt>.  Within the declaration of
<tt>struct list</tt>, we say that this type is the type of the
<tt>data</tt> element, and that the <tt>next</tt> pointer points to
another list cell that is instantiated on the <em>same</em> type.</p>

<p>Note that the <tt>TP</tt> annotation goes on the structure type itself,
not the pointer; therefore, it appears before the <tt>*</tt> when
declaring a pointer to a polymorphic structure.</p>

<a name="special-functions"/>
<h3>7. Special Functions</h3>

<p>Several standard C functions require special handling.  This section
discusses the annotations used to identify those functions.</p>

<a name="allocators"/>
<h4>7.1. Allocators</h4>

<p>Deputy requires the programmer to annotate any functions that behave as
allocators or deallocators.  These annotations identify arguments that
hold the size of the requested block as well as arguments that are
(directly) deallocated by the function.  These annotations allow Deputy to
make sense of the <tt>void *</tt> types typically used for allocator
results and deallocator arguments.</p>

<p>The standard allocation functions are annotated as follows:</p>

<div class="code">void * (<span class="annot">DALLOC(size)</span> malloc)(int size);
void * (<span class="annot">DREALLOC(p, size)</span> realloc)(void *p, int size);
void (<span class="annot">DFREE(p)</span> free)(void *p);
</div>

<p>First note that these annotations are placed on the function type using
the parenthetical syntax shown above.  The <tt>DALLOC</tt> annotation takes
an expression indicating the size of the allocated block.  (This argument
is a full expression, so <tt>calloc</tt> can be annotated by multiplying
the two arguments.)  The <tt>DREALLOC</tt> annotations indicates the name
of the argument that is freed as well as the size of the reallocated
block, as above.  The <tt>DFREE</tt> annotation indicates the name of the
argument that is freed.</p>

<p>Deputy currently does not ensure that the allocated block is zeroed.
This feature will soon be implemented for <tt>malloc</tt>, but it is
difficult to implement for <tt>realloc</tt>, since Deputy does not know
the size of the original allocated block.  Changing the implementations of
<tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>realloc</tt> may be appropriate in the long
run.</p>

<a name="memset-and-friends"/>
<h4>7.2. Memset and Friends</h4>

<p>Functions such as <tt>memset</tt>, <tt>memcmp</tt>, and <tt>memcpy</tt>
have annotations similar to the allocator annotations above.  Deputy has
special handling for these functions that allows many different types to
be used with the <tt>void *</tt> arguments as long as they are used
appropriately.</p>

<p>These annotations are subject to change soon and are therefore not
documented here.  Examples can be found in the header files!</p>
