Deputy compiler
- complain about functions without prototype


Deputy run-time checks
- compile the library with optimizations on (two versions)
- efficient checking sequences without code-cache pollution


Example: 
- in bh I had to turn the union into a struct because fields were used
differently in different stages of the computation. I should be able to add a
tag field though.
