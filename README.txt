Ivy is a compiler and runtime library for an extended dialect of C
that checks type, memory and concurrency safety. Ivy relies on a small
number of lightweight annotations in the source code to keep time and
space overheads reasonable. Ivy is implemented as a C-to-C compiler
using gcc as its backend.
